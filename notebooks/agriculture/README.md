# Agriculture in Niger

## Request

Using NASA remote sensing data, analyze changing trends in plantings. For each year over the past 10 years, analyze changes in the total square area of new plantings. For 2023-4, identify the total area of farms that have seen relatively consistent historic plantings but do not have observed plantings for the 2023-24 growing season. Monthly updates can be requested, if possible.

Using NASA remote sensing data, prepare historical drought analysis for Niger and bordering countries. Estimate hectares of farmland where drought has occurred over the past 5 years.

Combine the past 5 years of planting, drought, and conflict statistics to determine to what extent droughts and conflict may have impacted plantings.
